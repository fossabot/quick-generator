# Quick-Generator

Woohoo! Version 3.0 is here!

A *decently* fast way to generate a node project

### Usage

Quick-generator now implements sub commands!

I've also added support for yarn, so the app will now see check to see that you have yarn and if you do, it prefers it to the standard npm



##### Basics

`qg <command> [options] [project]`

##### flags

- `<r>` - initializes the new directory as a repo

##### commands

- electron `<e>` - generates an electron app
- go `<g>` - generates a go app
- init `<i>` - generates a project directory
- node `<n>` - generates a node app
- micro `<m>` - generates micro app
- polka `<p>` - generates polka app
- express `<e>` - generates an express app
- micro `<m>` - generates a zeit/micro app
